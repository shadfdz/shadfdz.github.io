<p> Hi! If you're on this page and you're wondering about me, I'm a former lab manufacturing specialist that decided he needed a career change after 7 years in the biotech space. 
     I recently completed a graduate degree in Big Data Analytics and I am highly interested in machine learning, neural networks and Big Data. </p>




<p> I currently reside in Cardiff-by-the-sea, CA, a small unincorportad town north of San Diego. In my spare time, I enjoy surfing, golf, food and photography.  </p>

<p class="mb-5"> Feel free to contact me through my contacts page if you have any questions about my work. I am hoping that my blog will be useful for those that are beginning their Data Sciene journey as well. </p>
