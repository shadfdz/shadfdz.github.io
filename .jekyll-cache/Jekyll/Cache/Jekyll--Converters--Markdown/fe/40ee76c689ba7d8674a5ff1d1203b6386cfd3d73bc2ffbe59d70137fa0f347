<p>Let’s start a data science project from scratch. In this series, we will analyze online customer intention (<a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset">source</a>) by following the CRISP-DM data science lifecycle process. For part 1, we’re going to setup our project, understand our data, and perform exploratory data analysis. For part 2, we’re going to focus on data cleansing and feature engineering methods. Part 3 will involve modeling our data and Part 4 will be deployment of our model using flask and Docker. Whew.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-the-workspace">Setting Up the Workspace</h2>
<p>For the project structure and setup, please checkout our github <a href="https://github.com/shadfdz/crispy-octo-spoon">repository</a>. Go ahead checkout the readme for instructions on how to setup the virtual environment if you want to do so. We will also be using pre-commit hooks on our code.</p>

<h2 id="business-question">Business Question</h2>
<p>Before we start loading our data on Pandas and analytizing it, let’s first understand our business question and our data. The dataset was originally used by <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00521-018-3523-0">Sakar et al</a> to propose a real-time online shopper behavior analysis system. The goal of the paper was the predict the purchasing intention of the customer and Web site abandonment likelihood. In this series, we’ll stick to the former and analyze and predict which behaviors of a customer will result to a higher likelihood of making a purchase.</p>

<h2 id="dataloading-and-understanding-the-data">Dataloading and Understanding the Data</h2>
<p>Let’s load our data and understand it. There are 10 numerical and 8 categorical attributes, where the “Revenue” column is indicates a purchase. This will be our indepednent variable.</p>

<p>The following tables are Table 1 and Table 2 of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00521-018-3523-0">Sakar et al</a>.</p>

The “Bounce Rate”, “Exit Rate” and “Page Value” features represent the metrics measured by “Google Analytics” for each page in the e-commerce site. The value of “Bounce Rate” feature for a web page refers to the percentage of visitors who enter the site from that page and then leave (“bounce”) without triggering any other requests to the analytics server during that session. The value of “Exit Rate” feature for a specific web page is calculated as for all pageviews to the page, the percentage that were the last in the session. The “Page Value” feature represents the average value for a web page that a user visited before completing an e-commerce transaction. The “Special Day” feature indicates the closeness of the site visiting time to a specific special day (e.g. Mother’s Day, Valentine’s Day) in which the sessions are more likely to be finalized with transaction. The value of this attribute is determined by considering the dynamics of e-commerce such as the duration between the order date and delivery date. For example, for Valentina’s day, this value takes a nonzero value between February 2 and February 12, zero before and after this date unless it is close to another special day, and its maximum value of 1 on February 8. The dataset also includes operating system, browser, region, traffic type, visitor type as returning or new visitor, a Boolean value indicating whether the date of the visit is weekend, and month of the year.</h2>
