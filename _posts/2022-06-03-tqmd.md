## First Post! - TQDM

Sweet, first post. I'll keep this super simple and short. 


Have you ever had to loop through a large list and you wonder how far along the iterator has progressed? There are definitely multiple ways to go about this but you might find the Python package, [tqdm](https://tqdm.github.io/), as a handy tool. Tqdm contains useful iterator functions that allow the user to view a progress bar while the loop is running.

According to the developers, 'tqdm' means progress in Arabic or can be an abbreviation for 'I love you so much' in Spanish.


### Installation

Seems like I need to upgrade pip. 



```python
!pip3 install tqdm
```

    Requirement already satisfied: tqdm in /Users/shadfernandez/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages (4.59.0)
    [33mWARNING: You are using pip version 21.3.1; however, version 22.1.2 is available.
    You should consider upgrading via the '/Users/shadfernandez/anaconda3/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.[0m


### TQDM.NOTEBOOK

Let's test out the `tqdm` package with selection sort. For this example, we will be importing tqdm for Ipython/Jupyter notebook. You can also use the non-notebook version but it's not as pretty on Jupyter notebook. We're going to utilize the `trange` function, which is similar to the `range` function but shows a progress bar.


```python
from tqdm.notebook import trange

my_list = [i for i in range(10000)]
random.shuffle(my_list)


for i in trange(len(my_list), desc='Test'):
    min_index = i
    for j in range(i + 1, len(my_list)):
        if my_list[min_index] > my_list[j]:
            min_index = j
            
    my_list[i], my_list[min_index] = my_list[min_index], my_list[i]

```

So the selection sort took 4 seconds at 4463.83 iterations per second on average. While we saw the completed progress bar above, the progress bar indicated an estimated completion time while it was in progress. 

If we want to iterate through the elements of a list, we can go ahead and use the `tqdm` function instead like below. Since we are not in a hurry, we can use the `sleep` function from Python's time module to pause every iteration for a designated amount of time.


```python
from tqdm.notebook import tqdm
from time import sleep

letter_list = ['a','b','c']

for letter in tqdm(letter_list):
    print(letter)
    sleep(1)
```

As we can see, the iteration rought took roughly 3 seconds with 1 iteration per second. 

This is super basic but hopefully it helps! Maybe you can time your coffee or bathroom break better while you're iterating through something. 

There are also a handful of parameters available also such as customizing the progress bar text. Please check out [tqdm](https://tqdm.github.io/)'s documentation page for more information. Thanks!
