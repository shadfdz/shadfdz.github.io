## Beginnigs of a Data Science Project! - TQDM

Let's start a data science project from scratch. In this series, we will start with a simple data science project and after which, we can work our way up and start adding useful tools to our project such as flask and docker. For part 1, we're going to setup our project and perform exploratory data analysis on our data. For part 2, we're going to focus on feature engineering with forward and backward elimination, PCA, brute force methods, and Featurewiz. Part 3, we're going to build our model and Part 4 will be flask and Docker. Whew!
